%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{Despite being self-taught, programming is so in-line to my way of thinking that people have often considered me a robot; sometimes an alien. I revel in complexity and always love that feeling of ignorance, and the subsequent emotion that comes with understanding. I'm up for any challenge and will take any opportunity to leave this world better than I found it.} % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
